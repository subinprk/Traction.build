# Idea Validation Platform Launch Site
        
Create a modern, responsive landing page for a startup called IdeaSpark — an AI-powered startup idea validation platform. The site should target founders, solo entrepreneurs, and early-stage startups.

The platform helps users test startup ideas quickly and cheaply using AI agents, auto-generated ads, and landing pages.

Include these sections/pages:
* Hero Section
  Headline: “Validate Your Startup Idea — Before You Build It”
  Subheadline: “IdeaSpark lets you test your startup idea with AI, real ads, and live feedback — all before writing a single line of code.”
  CTA Button: “Join Early Access for Free”
  Secondary CTA: “See How It Works”
  Hero Image: abstract or UI mockup of AI idea scoring / campaign dashboard.
* About Section
  Headline: “90% of startups fail — most because nobody needs their product.”
  Body: “IdeaSpark helps you avoid this fate by combining smart AI research with real user demand. We simulate launches, generate ads, run campaigns, and give you clear signals before you invest time or money building anything.”
* How It Works
  Step 1: Submit your idea
  Step 2: Our AI scores it and generates ad creatives + landing pages
  Step 3: We run real ad campaigns for you and collect live data
  Step 4: You get market-validated feedback and a simple sales funnel
  Emphasize that ads are optional and paid separately — we just automate the process.
* Pricing Page
  Freemium model:
  Free Plan: Access to idea scoring, manual export of assets
  Pro Plan (€80/month): Full automation – from ad setup to landing pages to campaign optimization
  Early Access Users: Get the Pro Plan for free during launch phase
  Note: Advertising costs are billed separately and depend on user’s ad spend.
* Checkout Page
  Emphasize “cancel anytime” and “early access is free”
  Note on ad spend: “Ad campaign costs are separate and based on actual usage. You control your budget.”
* FAQs
  “Do I need to pay for ads?” → Yes, but you control your ad budget.
  “Can I cancel anytime?” → Yes.
  “What’s included in the free plan?” → AI idea scoring and manual tools.
  “What’s included in the Pro plan?” → Full automation (ad setup, optimization, landing pages).
* Footer
  Links: Privacy Policy, Terms of Use, Contact
  Social Icons (LinkedIn, Twitter)
  Contact Email
Design Style:
Clean, minimal, startup feel (inspired by Stripe, Notion, Linear)
Use accent colors (blues, purples)
Rounded buttons, soft shadows, bold CTAs
I want the ui to feel dynamic like a startup with this vibe
